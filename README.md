# 🏦 Bank Loan Application System

A full-stack **Bank Loan Application System** built using **Laravel (REST API)** for the backend and **Angular** for the frontend.  
The system allows customers to apply for bank loans and track their application status, while administrators can review, approve, or reject loan requests.

This project was created as a **machine test / technical assessment** to demonstrate clean architecture, API design, and frontend–backend separation.
